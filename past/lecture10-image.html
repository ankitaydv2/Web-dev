The credit brlongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;nwho strives valinantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effortwithout error and shortcoming ; but who dooes actually strives to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a  worthycause; who at the best knows in the end the trimph of the high achievemment, and who at the wrost.&quot;
